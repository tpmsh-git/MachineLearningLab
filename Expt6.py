'''Expt. 6:NaÃ¯ve Bayes Classifier using Scikit learn library on Wine Dataset.
https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/naive-bayes-scikit-learn
Problem Statement: Wine classification  is a very famous multi-class classification problem. 
The Wine dataset is the result of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy 
but derived from three different cultivars. The Dataset comprises of 13 features 
(alcohol, malic_acid, ash, alcalinity_of_ash, magnesium, total_phenols, flavanoids, 
nonflavanoid_phenols, proanthocyanins, color_intensity, hue, od280/od315_of_diluted_wines, proline) 
and type of wine cultivar. This data has three type of wine Class_0, Class_1, and Class_2. 
Build a ML model to classify the type of wine.
